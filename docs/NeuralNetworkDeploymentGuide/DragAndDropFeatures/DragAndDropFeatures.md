# Drag-and-Drop Features

The drag-and-drop functionality adds a layer of convenience to the wrapper, enabling easy import and interaction with neural network models and MIDI files.

## Importing Neural Network Models

- **Supported Formats**: Import pre-trained neural network models in supported formats.
- **Dragging Models**: Click and drag the model file into the designated area within the plugin interface.
- **Customization**: Customize the import process as per your requirements.

## Dragging and Dropping MIDI Files

- **Supported MIDI Formats**: Import MIDI files for processing.
- **Dragging MIDI Files**: Simply drag and drop MIDI files into the plugin.
- **Processing MIDI Files**: The plugin automatically processes the imported MIDI files for playback and further editing.

## Customizing Behavior

- **Defining Drop Zones**: Customize drop zones for different file types.
- **Processing Options**: Define how files are processed upon dropping.
- **User Interaction**: Customize user feedback and interaction during drag-and-drop.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues related to drag-and-drop functionality and their solutions:

- **Unsupported File Types**: Guidelines on supported formats.
- **Difficulty in Dragging Files**: Solutions to common dragging issues.
- **Errors during File Processing**: Troubleshoot errors that may occur during file processing.
