# Neural Network Deployment Settings

## Integrating Generative Neural Networks

This section covers the steps to integrate your generative neural network models into the wrapper for deployment as VST3 plugins.

### Model Configuration

- **Model Path**: Specify the path to your pre-trained model.
- **Architecture Details**: Define the architecture of the neural network.
- **Hyperparameters**: Configure hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, etc.

### GUI and Interaction Parameters

- **Layout Configuration**: Customize the GUI layout to match your needs.
- **Color Schemes**: Choose color schemes for different elements.
- **Default Controls**: Set default values for controls and parameters.

### Thread Management and Real-time Processing

- **Thread Priorities**: Manage thread priorities for smooth real-time processing.
- **Queue Sizes**: Configure queue sizes to handle data flow efficiently.
- **Input Event Handling**: Define how input events are processed and handled.

### Debugging and Performance Monitoring

- **Enabling/Disabling Logs**: Control log output for debugging.
- **Log Levels**: Set different log levels for detailed debugging.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor performance metrics to optimize the plugin's operation.
